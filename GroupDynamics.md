### Group Dynamics 

*****

There are only two members in our team. It has been a pleasure working with my only teammate Weijie Liu. I think it's because we are both passionate about data science and are problem-oriented people. We are both excited to take advantage of this opportunity to apply our knowledge in statistics and computer science to a real world problem. In this report I will share my perspectives on our teamwork
in different aspects, including progress checking, commitment, job allocation and communication. 

1. Progress Checking

Everyweek week we have to meet at least two times during the labs. We often give each other updates on the project, let each other know if a new approach could be adopted and then communicate our concerns with the instructors. In the early stage of this project, we did a good job keeping up with the schedule. We did a literacture review on fraud detection in insurance companies and looked into classification models and performance metrics. We were able to understand the dataset and define the problem explictly. However, when it comes to the data cleaning stage, we were so involved in the process that we spend too much time on it. We did set goals but we were not about to finish data cleaning job as early as we desired. As we struggle cleaning and transforming the dataset, we also had some concerns and questions about the dataset. After we completed preparing the data for modelling, we were a little behind the schedule. We realised we had to build the model as soon as possible so that we could evaluate the performances later on. We were able to stick to set goals after it.
