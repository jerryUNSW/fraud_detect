### Group Dynamics 

*****

There are only two members in our team. It has been a pleasure working with my only teammate Weijia Liu. I think it's because we are both passionate about data science and are problem-oriented people. We are both excited to take advantage of this opportunity to apply our knowledge in statistics and computer science to a real world problem. In this report I will share my perspectives on our teamwork
in different aspects, including progress checking, commitment, job allocation and communication. 

1. Progress Checking

Everyweek week we have to meet at least two times during the labs. We often give each other updates on the project, let each other know if a new approach could be adopted and then communicate our concerns with the instructors. In the early stage of this project, we did a good job keeping up with the schedule. We did a literacture review on fraud detection in insurance companies and looked into classification models and performance metrics. We were able to understand the dataset and define the problem explictly. However, when it comes to the data cleaning stage, we were so involved in the process that we spend too much time on it. We did set goals but we were not about to finish data cleaning job as early as we desired. As we struggle cleaning and transforming the dataset, we also had some concerns and questions about the dataset. After we completed preparing the data for modelling, we were a little behind the schedule. We realised we had to build the model as soon as possible so that we could evaluate the performances later on. We were able to stick to set goals after it.

2. Commitment

I believe we are two committed, organised individuals. We always try to be on top of everything and do not want to be lagged behind. We are interested in the problem and we always try to find the best way to solve it. We also want to make sure our solution is practical and resembles how things are done in the real world. We always discuss the assumptions made about the dataset, approches we could try and whether we need to seek help from Jacky(the person who provided us the insurance dataset) or our instructors. 


3. Job Allocation

We always go through the work together and I feel like we are complementary. We make the big decisions together, including how to define our problems, how to do data cleanining, which models to include in our report and how to best present our results. 

Weijia is mainly responsible for literature review. She read many research papers on the subject matter and helped us figure out which methods the academia or the industry are already using. She does a good job in keeping a record of what's done and what's to be done. She also made the flowcharts to explain our data cleaning process. Weijia is not directly responsible for coding but her clear understanding of the problem and her critical thinking always help us get through the difficulties.

I am from the computational stream so I am mainly responsible for the coding part of the project. I wrtie shell command to clean the data, use Jupyter Notebook to build classfication models, visualise the dataset and results from the model, and organise the report in a markdown file. I also used a little bit of Rstudio to run the linear regression model. I also read some research papers about machine learning and cross validation to back up my reasoning and logic.

4. Communication

The communication between us has been smooth. We always have an open-minded about each others' new ideas. Even when we don't 100 percent agree with other, we would either test out the ideas and compare them, or seek advice from our instructors. We both try to be as friendly and cooperative as possible, which was not difficult because we are both responsible and committed. If one of us is expected to be late for a lab session, he or she would send a text to the other person in advance. If there is an upcoming due or deadline in this course, we often remind the other person of it as well. We value each other's strength and always treat each other in a respectful manner. 

5. What I have learned from teammwork experience

What I have learned from working with Weijie is that even when different people have different skillsets, they can always find a way to work together as long as they are both committed to the same goal. From the first day we met, we knew that we are very different people. We are good at different things and we approach the problem from different angles. However, our differences does not become an obstable between us. On the contrary, we found a way to complement each other by doing the thigs we are good at. This is not always the case when it comes to teammwork, but it is this way for us because we both make an effort to make it so.
