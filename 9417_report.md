# Recommender system using collaborative filtering

## Introduction
The Internet has enabled the retailers of books, movies, electronics, etc. to disseminate information about their products at a low cost. Nowadays, Customers could easily find themselves lost in the sea of information. Recommendation systems, which automatically takes in an process the user-generated data, can guide users by exposing interesting and unknown items products to them[1]. The BookCrossing dataset contains information about users, books and user's ratings from the BookCrossing online community. 

The goal of this project is to build different recommendation systems using collaborative filtering on BookCrossing data, and evaluate and compare their performances. Since in this dataset, infromation about books is more complete and accesible than that of people, the main focus is on item-based collaborative filtering. 

## Methods


we need to compare different recommendation system base on performance metrics 

1. random recommendation system 

2. item-based collaborative filtering (different kinds)

3. popularity recommendation

Performance metrics: 
diversity, coverage, serendipity, and novelty.

coverage: the % of things the system is able to hit 
Item coverage is the percentage of items included in the recommendation list over the number of potential items.

User specific analysis are not implemented well in our work, since there are only 
2 dimensions of a person.

Coverage gives a measurement of how well trained recommendation system perform
